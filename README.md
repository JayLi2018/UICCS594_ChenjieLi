# UIC Fall 2024 CS 594 project:

an evaluation of causal discovery algorithms and exploration on the application on relational data


This repository contains the code used in this project. 

for algorithms for single relations please refer to [this notebook](./test_causal_discovery_single.ipynb).

for algorithms for a database setting (RCD), i added an implementation file for a forked implementation [here][https://github.com/JayLi2018/sRCD]

This repo also contains the final project report [here](./project_report.pdf) and the literature review report [here][./literature_report.pdf]
