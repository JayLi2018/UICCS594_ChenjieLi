# TheAnalysisAndComparisionOfDifferentCausalModelsOnRleationalData
This is the repository for UIC Fall 2024 CS594 class project

As we know, "correlation is not causation", people have been using different models
to tackle the causality in different domains. 

The goal of this project are:
1. study and evaluate their genesis (i.e., under which circumstances were they introduced and why are they different)
2. How to make them applicable in relational databases:
    a) what assumptions should be made
    b) what do we need in order to make causal inference work in relational database
3. experimentally demonstrate the correctness of the results from 2)
